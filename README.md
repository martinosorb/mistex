# mistex

## Manifesto
The objective of mistex is to **do with latex what usual markdown compilers do
with HTML**. In other words, you will still have to write latex code for all
advanced functions and custom tweaks. 

### What mistex intends to be
- A simple way to turn markdown into professional-looking PDF documents
- A way of writing latex code without verbose commands like `\textbf{}`
and too many curly brackets getting in the way of your thinking
- An easier way to get some additional niceties like bibliography and page
numbers without knowing latex
- A way to have similar looking HTML and PDF versions of the same text (limited
to basic markdown functionalities)

### What mistex is not
- More powerful or complete than latex
- Simpler than latex while performing advanced functions or customizations
