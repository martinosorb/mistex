``latex-style quotation marks should not be affected''

`same for single apices'

"conversely, quotation marks should be converted to latex-style"

'same for single apices.'

The behaviour should be consistent in 'single line' or "single line" cases.

The apostrophe's not affected. Latex comm\'ands also not affected.
