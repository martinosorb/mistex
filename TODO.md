- Image is not in the right place.
- No space after italic, link, and after & in certain cases.
- Descriptions have problems with multiline. Do this after solving the previous.
- Problem with items in lists: too many spaces, latex does buggy things
- Smart ellipsis and quotation marks
- Tables:
  - require more space before and after; maybe use `table` instead of `tabular`
  - doesn't work with hlines on top and bottom
  - doesn't work without vertical bars
  - haven't tested alignments
